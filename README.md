## About The Project

As a developer, my goal was to create a complete, end-to-end gaming experience that combines the nostalgia of 2D platformers with the power of modern backend technologies. "Merciless Warrior" was born out of a passion for both game development and software engineering.

The game client is intentionally built using **Java Swing**, to explore the challenges of creating a game engine from scratch.

The backend is a powerful, event-driven system designed for scalability and separation of concerns. It features a microservices architecture for core gameplay logic and a complete data pipeline using Kafka and Apache Spark for real-time analytics. This demonstrates an approach to modern application development, from the user interface to data processing.

This project is a personal journey into the depths of game creation, backend architecture, and data engineering.

## Key Features

### Gameplay Features

- **Engaging 2D Platformer Gameplay:** Navigate through diverse levels, battling a variety of enemies with unique attack patterns.
- **Rich Combat System:** Combine melee attacks, special abilities, and powerful spells to overcome foes.
- **Deep Itemization:** Buy, sell, craft, and collect a wide array of items.
- **Character Progression:** Upgrade your character by collecting coins and tokens, unlocking new perks and enhancing your abilities.
- **Open-World Structure:** Explore a connected world, with the ability to backtrack to previous levels.
- **Challenging Boss Fights:** Test your skills against formidable bosses.

- **Save & Load System:** Save your progress locally on your computer or in the cloud to continue your adventure from anywhere.
- **Competitive Leaderboard:** Compete with other players and climb the ranks on the global leaderboard.

### Technical Features

- **Custom Game Engine:** Built entirely from scratch using Java Swing.
- **Microservices Architecture:** The backend is composed of several containerized services:
    - **Authentication Service:** Manages user registration, login, and secure JWT-based authentication. Implements rate limiting with Redis.
    - **Game Service:** Handles all core game data, including player progression, inventory, and leaderboards.
    - **API Gateway:** A single entry point for all client requests, routing them to the appropriate service.
    - **Service Registry:** Allows services to dynamically discover and communicate with each other.
- **Asynchronous Data & Analytics Pipeline:**
    - **Apache Kafka:** The Game Service produces events in Avro format to a Kafka topic, decoupling game logic from data analysis.
    - **Analytics Service (Scala & Apache Spark):** A dedicated service that consumes events from Kafka. It features:
        - A **Spark Structured Streaming** job to process data in real-time and write it to a Parquet-based data lake.
        - An on-demand **Spark Batch Job** to run complex queries on the data lake and generate analytical reports.
- **Containerized & Orchestrated:** The entire backend ecosystem is containerized with **Docker** and managed with **Docker Compose**.
- **Resilient & Secure by Design:**
    - The Game Service uses resilience patterns like **Circuit Breakers** and **Retries** to handle potential failures in inter-service communication.
    - The backend is secured using **Spring Security** for authentication and authorization.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a local copy up and running.

### Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 17** or newer.
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose**.
- An IDE that supports Java/Gradle projects (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA).

### Installation & Launch

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/VasilijeJukic01/MercilessWarrior-Java.git
    cd MercilessWarrior-Java
    ```

2.  **Start the Backend Services:**
    Open a terminal in the root directory and run the following Docker Compose command. This will build the images for each microservice and start them, along with the databases, Redis, and Kafka.
    ```sh
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    Wait for all the services to start up. You can monitor the logs with `docker-compose logs -f`.

3.  **Run the Game Client:**
  - Open the `core` directory as a project in your IDE.
  - Let the IDE sync the Gradle dependencies.
  - Locate and run the `Launcher.java` file (`core/src/main/java/platformer/launcher/Launcher.java`).

    The game launcher should now appear, allowing you to start playing!

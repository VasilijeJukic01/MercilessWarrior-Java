Object Blacksmith0:
Perk upgrades are a way to enhance your abilities and skills. As you gain experience and progress in the game, you'll earn tokens.
These tokens can be used to unlock various perks.
You earn tokens by completing quests, defeating enemies, and making progress in the game. The tougher the challenge, the more you'll earn.
To upgrade a perk, you need to spend tokens.
I've got a selection of powerful perks that can give you the edge you need in your journey.

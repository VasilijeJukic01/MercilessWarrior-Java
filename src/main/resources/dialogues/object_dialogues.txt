Object Blacksmith:
Perk upgrades are a way to enhance your character's abilities and skills. As you gain experience and progress in the game, you'll earn tokens.
These tokens can be used to unlock various perks.
You earn tokens by completing quests, defeating enemies, and generally making progress in the game. The tougher the challenge, the more tokens you'll earn.
To upgrade a perk, you need to spend tokens.
I've got a selection of powerful perks that can give you the edge you need in your journey.
